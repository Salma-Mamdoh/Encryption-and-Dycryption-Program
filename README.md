# Encryption & Decryption Program
This program have 7 differant ciphers in different ideas.
# List of Ciphers :
# 1.Affine Cipher.<br/>
In affine cipher each letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter. Letter A is given number 0 and letter Z is given number 25. Each letter is encrypted with the function (5x + 8) mod 26. The decryption function is 21(y âˆ’ 8) mod 26.<br/>
# 2.Caesar Cipher.<br/> 
Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter at some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a right shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B
would become E, X becomes A, and so on.<br/>
# 3.Atbash Cipher.<br/> 
The Atbash cipher is a very common, simple cipher. Basically, when encoded, an "A" becomes a "Z", "B" turns into "Y", etc.<br/>
# 4.Vignere Cipher.<br/>
In this method, a keyword is repeatedly added character by character to each alphabetic letter in the original message. The addition is carried out using the ASCII codes for each of the characters, modulo 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet), and the result is added to the code for the letter 'A' in the ASCII code sequence.<br/>
# 5.Baconian Cipher.<br/>
To encode a message, each letter of the plaintext is replaced by a group of five of the letters 'A' or 'B'. This replacement is a binary encoding.<br/>
# 6.Simple Substitution Cipher.<br/>
In this cipher i create a general version that builds the cipher alphabet using a given key of 5 unique letters. The user enters the key to cipher a message and the same key to decipher the message. The cipher alphabet is built by adding the remaining 21 letters in order after the key letters.this chipher (only) Encryption.<br/>
# 7.Morse Code.<br/> 
It is a code consisting of two symbols dot and dash and used to in the telegraph system in the past and also communicate messages in primitive ways.
